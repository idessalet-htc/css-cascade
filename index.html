    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
    <p>I might be new to web development, but I've learned a lot so far.</p>

    <h3>GitHub</h3>
    <p>
        I've learned to manage code in repositories on GitHub.  This allows me
        to be able to work on my projects anywhere.  No more worries about
        losing a portable drive!
    </p>

    <h3>Basic HTML</h3>
    <p>
        I've also learned to write some of the most common HTML tags, and to
        write HTML for structure not appearance. Some of the tags that I've
        learned include headings (&lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;, etc.),
        paragraphs, and lists.  I've also learned to use special entity characters.
    </p>

    <h3>Favorite Things</h3>
    <p>The things I like best about this class and what I'm learning are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>accesing the files from the Internet.</li>
        <li>ceating the pages.</li>
        <li>uploading to github.</li>
    </ol>
